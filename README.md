# scrape_real-estate_properties
This is a project that deals with Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and also building an ETL pipeline.

ETL simply means Extract, Transform and Load. In this case, the data is extracted from a homogenous source which 
is [realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/) , transformed, stored and later loaded for proper data analytics all using 
python libraries for each process.
## STEP ONE
Import all the necessary python libraries needed to complete the project.

The libraries used here are:

+ BeautifulSoup as bs4
+ pandas as pd
+ sqlalchemy
+ numpy as np
+ urllib.parse
